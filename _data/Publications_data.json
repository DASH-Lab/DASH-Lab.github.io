        "abstract": "The widespread use of synthetic image generation models and the challenges associated with authenticity preservation have fueled the demand for robust watermarking methods to safeguard authenticity and protect the copyright of synthetic images. Existing watermarking methods embed. Invisible signatures in synthetic images often compromise image quality and remain susceptible to multiple watermark removal attacks, including reconstruction and forgery methods. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel watermarking approach, AEON, which seamlessly integrates the watermark into the latent diffusion process and ensures the watermark aligns with scene semantics in the final image. Unlike existing invisible in-diffusion watermarking and traditional hash-based methods, our approach adapts the neural synthesized hash-based watermark to the semantics of the generated image during the intermediate diffusion process instead of embedding traditional hashes with the initial noise. This facilitates visual coherence in the generated image while enhancing adversarial robustness and resilience against single or multiple adversarial and traditional watermark removal attacks. Our proposed approach a) modulates the noise sampling in each diffusion denoising iteration through a learnable watermark embedding, b) optimizes consistency, reconstruction, and similarity loss, enforcing local and global alignment between the watermark structure and the underlying image content, and c) generates a strong watermark by allowing late embedding of the watermark in the diffusion process. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in retaining quality and its robustness against cumulative adversarial attacks."

While many existing unlearning methods rely on the retain data to mitigate the performance decline caused by forgetting, such data may not always be available (retain-free) in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge posed by retain-free unlearning, we introduce RUAGO, utilizing adversarial soft labels to mitigate over-unlearning and a generative model pretrained on out-of-distribution (OOD) data to effectively distill the original model’s knowledge. We introduce a progressive sampling strategy to incrementally increase synthetic data complexity, coupled with an inversion-based alignment step that ensures the synthetic data closely matches the original training distribution. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing retain-free methods and achieves comparable or superior performance relative to retain-based approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in real-world, data-constrained environments."

This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on Moiré-affected videos an issue that has received little attention. We collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from Celeb-DF, DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera angles. To further examine the influence of Moiré patterns on deepfake detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoiréFake, referred to as (DMF) dataset, and two synthetic Moiré generation techniques. Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moiré artifacts degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moiré patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoiréing methods, intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing accuracy by up to 16%. These findings underscore the urgent need for detection models that can robustly handle Moiré distortions alongside other real-world challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection."

While prior studies focus on isolated manipulations, little is known about model behavior under such compositional manipulation pipelines. In this work, we introduce FakeChain, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1-, 2-, and 3-Step manipulated face images synthesized using five state-of-the-art generators, including face-swap, GAN, and Diffusion models. Using this dataset, we analyze detection performance and spectral properties across manipulation depths, generator combinations, and quality settings. Our findings reveal that detection performance highly depends on the final manipulation step, with F1-score dropping by up to 58.83% when it differs from training. Detectors rely on shallow cues from the last stage, limiting generalization across multi-step forgeries. We also observe architectural differences in robustness to compression, with attention-based models being more sensitive than CNN-based ones. These insights highlight the need for detection models that account for manipulation history and benchmarks such as FakeChain that reflect the evolving nature of deepfake synthesis pipelines. We share some sample of our code here."

This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader AI-generated content (AIGC) cases that feature fully synthesized scenes. As such content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the integrity of visual media is undergoing threat. To address this issue, we propose a physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics, resulting in globally sharp or physically inconsistent blur patterns. To capture these discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative feature for detecting manipulated content. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics."

However, the driving data collected during development are limited and lack diversity, leading to late or aggressive braking. Moreover, it is necessary to effectively identify anomalies in braking patterns, which is critical for self-driving autonomous vehicles. We propose Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equation Normalizing Flow (GDFlow), which leverages Normalizing Flow (NF) with Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to learn the distribution of normal driving patterns. Our approach captures spatio-temporal information from sensor data and accurately models continuous changes in driving patterns. Additionally, we introduce a quantilebased maximum likelihood objective to improve the likelihood estimate of normal data at the margin of the distribution. We validate GDFlow using real-world electric vehicle driving data that we collected from Hyundai IONIQ5 and GV80EV. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to nine baselines across four dataset configurations of different vehicle types and drivers. Furthermore, our model outperforms the latest anomaly detection methods across four time series benchmark datasets. Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency in inference time compared to existing methods. We plan to deploy GDFlow in the Hyundai Genesis GV90 by March 2026."

The main challenge is to eliminate the influence of a specific subset of training data from a pretrained model while preserving the model’s performance on the retain set without retraining it from scratch. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient unlearning framework based on Optimal Transport, which can effectively work on class and instance-wise unlearning tasks. By analyzing and comparing the feature spaces of the original and retrained models, we formulate the unlearning problem as a distribution alignment task between the forget set and the retain set. We guide the feature distribution of the forget set, which initially forms distinct, structured patterns, to align with that of the retain set. In addition, we introduce a class-aware cost function for optimal transport that encourages inter-class transport, thereby enhancing the forgetting process. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior effectiveness compared to previous SOTA methods."

Such methods have further improved detection performance by incorporating additional scene-level context from both visual and textual domains. However, existing methods approximate scene context by simply averaging the text embeddings of the image’s object labels, which is insufficient to capture the rich linguistic context present in RS scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Feature-Aligned Scene Encoding (FASE), which constructs comprehensive scene representations through high-quality captions generated by a specialized vision-language model. These caption embeddings are then aligned with visual features through a Feature Alignment Module (FAM) that employs dual-branch fusion with gating and cross-attention mechanisms. By utilizing enhanced scene encoding only during training, our method internalizes rich contextual knowledge while maintaining inference efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach for OVD in RS."

First, we propose Landmark-based Distillation (LBD), motivated by I-JEPA's representation learning approach. LBD utilizes KL-divergence to align facial landmark predictions from visual and audio encoders, enforcing focus on geometric facial features rather than spurious background information. Second, we introduce Multimodal Temporal Information Alignment (MTIA), which employs contrastive learning to enhance temporal consistency between audio and visual representations. We conduct extensive experiments on academic datasets and web-based deepfakes collected from diverse social media platforms, serving as real-world examples.

However, real-world applications often require recognizing the same individual using fingerprints from different fingers, which is finger-agnostic identity recognition (FaIR). The FaIR task has proven challenging due to the prevailing assumption in the biometric field that there is no correlation between an individual’s different fingerprints. To address this issue, we propose a novel system, IP-Fing, which can learn the interpersonal similarity across the fingers. By using a pre-trained localization encoder to capture interpersonal fingerprint landmarks and the ArcFace marginal logit function, our IP-Fing recognition system can match a fingerprint query to all fingerprints of the same person while distinguishing them from others. We assess our method using comprehensive tests on two fingerprint datasets: our private fingerprint dataset, KORFing, which only has one sample per finger available, and the public fingerprint dataset, CASIA-v5, which has a few missing fingerprint samples for the task of finger-agnostic identity recognition (FaIR). IP-Fing achieves the best AUC with an average of 95.3074 across the two datasets, showing that our method is more effective in applying FaIR than conventional methods. Furthermore, IP-Fing demonstrates superior AUC with an average of 98.4631 across two datasets in the task of traditional finger-specific identity recognition (FsIR)."

While existing detection systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they typically function as black-box models—offering limited transparency and minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic, and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations aligned with Grad-CAM activations. Human evaluation with non-expert participants confirms the perceived usefulness, understandability, and trustworthiness of the generated narratives. By unifying prediction and explanation in a coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to interpretable deepfake detection—advancing the broader vision of trustworthy and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments."

We propose the Spectral Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust deepfake detection. The core \\textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)} decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also introduce the \\textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining real-time feasibility.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive, as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the research community."

        "abstract": "Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled with specific words. For example, when generating an image of \"Charlie Chaplin\", a \"mustache\" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not to include it, as the concept of \"mustache\" is strongly entangled with \"Charlie Chaplin\". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image, and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt the delta vector into the cross-attention mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing the delta vector, which previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics."

However, existing methods often lack robustness against various transformations primar ily including distortions, image regeneration, and adver sarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking ap proach for robust and invisible image watermarking. Un like prior approaches, we embed the message inside hid den convolution layers by converting from the spatial do main to the frequency domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed by wavelet pro jection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Trans form approximation to transform spatial data into the fre quency domain efficiently. In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse attacks, includ ing adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distor tions, ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder leverages Parseval’s theorem to ef fectively learn and extract the watermark pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark’s invisibility, capacity, and robustness. Compre hensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models."

To mitigate potential social disruption, it is crucial to quickly detect the authenticity of each deepfake content hidden in a sea of information. While researchers have worked on developing deep learning-based methods, the deepfake datasets utilized in these studies are far from the real world in terms of their qualities; most popular deepfake datasets are human-distinguishable. To address this problem, we present a novel deepfake dataset, HiDF, a high-quality and humanindistinguishable deepfake dataset consisting of 62 K images and 8 K videos. HiDF is a meticulously curated dataset that includes diverse subjects that have undergone rigorous quality checks. A comparison of the quality between HiDF and existing deepfake datasets demonstrates that HiDF is human-indistinguishable. Hence, it can be a valuable benchmark dataset for deepfake detection tasks."

This study reveals that the synthesized nature of self-representations in deepfakes introduces artificiality that triggers discomfort, thereby increasing resistance to mental health self-disclosure messages. This discomfort underscores a significant limitation of deepfake technology in sensitive contexts, as individuals—especially those with higher baseline levels of mental health who find greater relevance to the topic—may be reluctant to engage with messages that present uncanny or distorted self-representations. Our findings emphasize the importance of future research to systematically investigate the boundaries of self-referencing in AI-driven synthetic media, focusing on how the degree of resemblance influences perceptions of personal relevance, evokes emotional resistance, and varies across individual differences. Furthermore, as deepfake technology finds its way into the healthcare sector, practitioners must remain mindful that while it offers innovative possibilities, it may also stir emotional resistance."

Moreover, there is no robust millionscale multimodal NSFW dataset with both prompt and image pairs with adversarial examples. In this work, we propose a large-scale prompt and image dataset, generated using open-source diffusion models. Also, we develop a multimodal classification model to distinguish safe and NSFW text and images, which has robustness against adversarial attacks, and directly alleviates the current challenges. Our extensive experimental results show that our model shows good performance against existing SOTA NSFW detection methods in terms of accuracy and recall, and drastically reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in multimodal adversarial attack scenarios."

A reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark removal across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) watermarking techniques demonstrate SADRE’s superiority in balancing watermark disruption and image quality, achieving the best performance in PSNR, SSIM, Wasserstein Distance, and Bit Recovery Accuracy.

In order to solve this problem, various deep learning-based algorithms are developed to provide driving stability by learning the driving data. Among those artificial intelligence algorithms, anomaly detection algorithms can successfully separate the deceleration data in abnormal driving situations, and the resulting refined deceleration data can be used to train the regression model to achieve better driving stability.

Despite the prevalence of sexually exploitative deepfake, no existing approach has combined Not Safe For Work (NSFW) detection with deepfake detection. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel integrated process that first implements NSFW detection to assess urgency and identify sexual components before proceeding to deepfake detection. To verify the effectiveness of this process, we generated eight FaceSwap images. In addition, we utilized these images to evaluate the performance of the NSFW and deepfake detection models, achieving an accuracy of 87.5% and 100%, respectively. The results demonstrated the viability of a sequential detection approach. This research highlights the importance of combining NSFW and deepfake detection for more efficient and urgent content moderation, providing a practical tool for law enforcement and victim support organizations. In our findings, this research presents a paradigm that enables rapid responses to address the harms caused by deepfake content effectively and promotes a more proactive approach to content moderation."

However, these pervasive utilities in the cloud environment unavoidably encounter security and privacy issues. In particular, a membership inference attack (MIA) poses a threat by recognizing the presence of a data sample in a training set for the target model. Although prior MIA approaches underline privacy risks repeatedly by demonstrating experimental results with standard benchmark datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR, the effectiveness of such techniques on a real-world dataset remains questionable. We are the first to perform an in-depth empirical study on black-box-based MIAs that hold realistic assumptions, including six metric-based and three classifier-based MIAs with the high-dimensional image dataset that consists of identification (ID) cards and driving licenses. Additionally, we introduce the Siamese-based MIA that shows similar or better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches and suggest training a shadow model with autoencoder-based reconstructed images. Our major findings show that the performance of MIA techniques against too many features may be degraded; the MIA configuration or a sample's properties can impact the accuracy of membership inference on members and non-members."

In light of the recent advancements in the robustness of classifiers, we delve deep into the intricacies of adversarial training and Jacobian regularization, two pivotal defenses. Our work is the first carefully analyzes and characterizes these two schools of approaches, both theoretically and empirically, to demonstrate how each approach impacts the robust learning of a classifier. Next, we propose our novel Optimal Transport with Jacobian regularization  method, dubbed OTJR, bridging the input Jacobian regularization with the a output representation alignment by leveraging the optimal transport theory. In particular, we employ the Sliced Wasserstein distance that can efficiently push the adversarial samples’ representations closer to those of clean samples, regardless of the number of classes within the dataset. The SW distance provides the adversarial samples’ movement directions, which are much more informative and powerful for the Jacobian regularization. Our empirical evaluations set a new standard in the domain, with our method achieving commendable accuracies of 52.57% on CIFAR-10 and 28.36% on CIFAR-100 datasets under the AutoAttack. Further validating our model’s practicality, we conducted real-world tests by subjecting internet-sourced images to online adversarial attacks. These demonstrations highlight our model’s capability to counteract sophisticated adversarial perturbations, affirming its significance and applicability in real-world scenarios."

Yet, ITS often relies on data from traffic sensors or vehicle devices, where certain cities might not have all those smart devices or enabling infrastructures. Also, recent studies have employed meta-learning to generalize spatial-temporal traffic networks, utilizing data from multiple cities for effective traffic forecasting for data-scarce target cities. However, collecting data from multiple cities can be costly and time-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Single Source Meta-Transfer Learning (SSMT ) which relies only on a single source city for traffic prediction. Our method harnesses this transferred knowledge to enable few-shot traffic forecasting, particularly when the target city possesses limited data. Specifically, we use memory-augmented attention to store the heterogeneous spatial knowledge from the source city and selectively recall them for the data-scarce target city. We extend the idea of sinusoidal positional encoding to establish meta-learning tasks by leveraging diverse temporal traffic patterns from the source city. Moreover, to capture a more generalized representation of the positions we introduced a meta-positional encoding that learns the most optimal representation of the temporal pattern across all the tasks. We experiment on five real-world benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing methods in time series traffic prediction."

However, digital marketing agencies often struggle with incomplete user profiles and interaction details from Advertising Identifier (ADID) data in user behavior modeling. To address this, Korea Telecom (KT), a leading telecommunication and big data service provider in South Korea, introduces the Deep Journey Hierarchical Attention Networks (DJHAN). This novel method enhances conversion predictions by leveraging heterogeneous action sequences associated with ADIDs and encapsulating these interactions into structured journeys. These journeys are hierarchically aggregated to effectively represent ADID’s behavioral attributes. Moreover, DJHAN incorporates three specialized attention mechanisms: temporal attention for time-sensitive contexts, action attention for emphasizing key behaviors, and journey attention for highlighting influential journeys in the purchase conversion process. Emprically, DJHAN surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across three diverse datasets, including real-world data from NasMedia, a leading media representative in Asia. In backtesting simulations with three advertisers, DJHAN outperforms existing baselines, achieving the highest improvements in Conversion Rate (CVR) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) across three advertisers, demonstrating its practical potential in digital marketing."

        "abstract": "Photo restoration technology enables preserving visual memories in photographs. However, physical prints are vulnerable to various forms of deterioration, ranging from physical damage to loss of image quality, etc. While restoration by human experts can improve the quality of outcomes, it often comes at a high price in terms of cost and time for restoration. In this work, we present the AI- based photo restoration framework composed of multiple stages, where each stage tailored to enhance and restore specific types of photo damage, accelerating and automating the photo restoration process. By integrating these techniques into a unified architecture, our framework aims to offer a one-stop solution for restoring old and deteriorated photographs. Furthermore, we present a novel old photo restoration dataset due to the lack of publicly available dataset for our evaulation."

        "abstract": "There have been significant advancements in anomaly detection in an unsupervised manner, where only normal images are available for training. Several recent methods aim to detect anomalies based on a memory, comparing or reconstructing the input with directly stored normal features (or trained features with normal images). However, such memory-based approaches operate on a discrete feature space implemented by the nearest neighbor or attention mechanism, suffering from poor generalization or an identity shortcut issue outputting the same as input, respectively. Furthermore, the majority of existing methods are designed to detect single-class anomalies, resulting in unsatisfactory performance when presented with multiple classes of objects. To tackle all of the above challenges, we propose CRAD, a novel anomaly detection method for representing normal features within a “continuous” memory,enabled by transforming spatial features into coordinates and mapping them to continuous grids. Furthermore, we carefully design the grids tailored for anomaly detection, representing both local and global normal features and fusing them effectively. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CRAD successfully generalizes the normal features and mitigates the identity shortcut, furthermore, CRAD effectively handles diverse classes in a single model thanks to the high-granularity continuous representation. In an evaluation using the MVTec AD dataset, CRAD significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by reducing 65.0% of the error for multi-class unified anomaly detection."

        "abstract": "Radiography images inherently possess globally consistent structures while exhibiting significant diversity in local anatomical regions, making it challenging to model their normal features through unsupervised anomaly detection. Since unsupervised anomaly detection methods localize anomalies by utilizing discrepancies between learned normal features and input abnormal features, previous studies introduce a memory structure to capture the normal features of radiography images. However, these approaches store extremely localized image segments in their memory, causing the model to represent both normal and pathological features with the stored components. This poses a significant challenge in unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing the disparity between learned features and abnormal features. Furthermore, with the diverse settings in radiography imaging, the above issue is exacerbated: more diversity in the normal images results in stronger representation of pathological features. To resolve the issues above, we propose a novel pathology detection method called Patch-wise Vector Quantization (P-VQ). Unlike the previous methods, P-VQ learns vector-quantized representations of normal \"patches\" while preserving its spatial information by incorporating vector similarity metric. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for selecting features in the memory to further enhance the robustness against diverse imaging settings. P-VQ even mitigates the \"index collapse\" problem of vector quantization by proposing top-k% dropout. Our extensive experiments on the BMAD benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of P-VQ against existing state-of-the-art methods."

The impact of Moiré patterns remains largely unexplored for deepfake detectors. In this study, we investigate how camera-captured deepfake videos from digital screens affect detector performance. We conducted experiments using two prominent datasets, CelebDF and FF++, comparing the performance of four state-of-the-art detectors on camera-captured deepfake videos with introduced Moiré patterns. Our findings reveal a significant decline in detector accuracy, with none achieving above 68% on average.

With the increasing number of satellites, the risk of collisions between satellites and space debris has escalated, potentially leading to significant property and human losses. Therefore,\naccurately modeling the orbit is critical for satellite operations. In this work, we propose the Decomposed Attention Segment Recurrent Neural Network (DASR) model, adding two key components, Multi-Head Attention and Tensor Train Decomposition, to SegRNN for orbit prediction. The DASR model applies Multi-Head Attention before segmenting at input data and before the input of the GRU layers. In addition, Tensor Train (TT) Decomposition is applied to the weight matrices of the Multi-Head Attention in both the encoder and decoder. For evaluation, we use three real-world satellite datasets from the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI),\nwhich are currently operating: KOMPSAT-3, KOMPSAT-3A, and KOMPSAT-5 satellites. Our proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to other SOTA baseline models. We demonstrate that our approach is 94.13% higher predictive performance than the second-best model in the KOMPSAT-3 dataset, 89.79% higher in the KOMPSAT-3A dataset, and 76.71% higher in the KOMPSAT-3 dataset."

To address this issue, we present a novel approach, DynaPP, which arranges object candidate regions into a compact form. DynaPP performs resource intensive whole-image inference only on sparse key frames, employing reduced resolutions for inference on other frames. Additionally, we propose transforming a 1-stage detector into a dynamic resolution model to facilitate frame inference at reduced resolutions. Here, the dynamic resolution model signifies a model capable of inferring all resolutions, distinguishing itself from typical models by not having restricted inferable resolutions. Unlike prior studies introducing new model structures for multi-resolution models, our work demonstrates that slight modifications to existing models can convert them to dynamic resolution models. DynaPP showcases substantial acceleration in video detection across four representative video datasets: AUAIR (5.5×), UAVDT (3.67×), VisDrone (2.73×), and ImageNet VID (3.69×), while maintaining a mean average precision with a small loss (≤2.2). Furthermore, we observed that our method achieves a detection acceleration of up to 8.84×, depending on the video clip."

        "abstract": "The fabrication of visual misinformation on the web and social media has increased exponentially with the advent of foundational text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, Stable Diffusion inpainters allow the synthesis of maliciously inpainted images of personal and private figures, and copyrighted contents, also known as deepfakes. To combat such generations, a disruption framework, namely Photoguard, has been proposed, where it adds adversarial noise to the context image to disrupt their inpainting synthesis. While their framework suggested a diffusion-friendly approach, the disruption is not sufficiently strong and it requires a significant amount of GPU and time to immunize the context image. In our work, we re-examine both the minimal and favorable conditions for a successful inpainting disruption, proposing DDD, a \"Digression guided Diffusion Disruption\" framework. First, we identify the most adversarially vulnerable diffusion timestep range with respect to the hidden space. Within this scope of noised manifold, we pose the problem as a semantic digression optimization. We maximize the distance between the inpainting instance's hidden states and a semantic-aware hidden state centroid, calibrated both by Monte Carlo sampling of hidden states and a discretely projected optimization in the token space. Effectively, our approach achieves stronger disruption and a higher success rate than Photoguard while lowering the GPU memory requirement, and speeding the optimization up to three times faster."

Our system takes a deepfake video as input, allowing users to upload videos and select different detectors, and provides detection results on whether the uploaded video is a deepfake or not. Furthermore, we provide an analysis tool that enables the video to be analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis with the probability of each frame being manipulated.

Traditional methods have focused on designing learning objectives and additional modules to isolate domain-specific features while retaining domain-invariant characteristics in their representations. In this paper, we introduce GAC-FAS, a novel learning objective that encourages the model to converge towards an optimal flat minimum without necessitating additional learning modules. Unlike conventional sharpness-aware minimizers, GAC-FAS identifies ascending points for each domain and regulates the generalization gradient updates at these points to align coherently with empirical risk minimization (ERM) gradient updates. This unique approach specifically guides the model to be robust against domain shifts. We demonstrate the efficacy of GAC-FAS through rigorous testing on challenging cross-domain FAS datasets, where it establishes state-of-the-art performance."

Specifically, our proposed STLGRU can effectively capture dynamic local and global spatial-temporal relations of traffic networks using memory-augmented attention and gating mechanism in a continuously synchronized manner. Moreover, instead of employing separate temporal and spatial components, we show that our memory module and gated unit can successfully learn the spatial-temporal dependencies, with reduced memory usage and fewer parameters. Extensive experimental results on three real-world public traffic datasets demonstrate that our method can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational efficiency."

This system maintains the distance between the ego and front vehicles without controlling the brake pedal. Since the strength of regenerative braking is generally determined based on calibration data determined during the vehicle development process, some driver could suffer inconvenience when the regenerative braking is activated differently from their driving habits. In order to solve this problem, various deep learning-based algorithms are developed to provide driving stability by learning the driving data. Among those artificial intelligence algorithms, anomaly detection algorithms can successfully separate the deceleration data in abnormal driving situations, and the resulting refined deceleration data can be used to train the regression model to achieve better driving stability. In this study, we extensively compare and evaluate the performance of clustering and anomaly detection methods."

Towards achieving this goal, we propose a novel TTA approach involv- ing two effective strategies. First, we progressively estimate the global Batch Normalization (BN) statistics of the target distribution with incoming data stream. Leveraging these statistics during inference has the ability to effectively reduce domain gap. Furthermore, we enhance prediction quality by refining the predicted masks using global class centers. Both strategies employ dynamic momentum for fast and stable convergence. Notably, our method is back-propagation-free and hence fast and lightweight, making it highly suitable for on-the-fly adaptation to new domain. Through comprehen- sive experiments across various domain adaptation scenarios, we demonstrate the robust performance of our method."

        "abstract": "Text-to-Image models such as Stable Diffusion have shown impressive image generation synthesis, thanks to the utilization of large-scale datasets. However, these datasets may contain sexually explicit, copyrighted, or undesirable content, which allows the model to directly generate them. Given that retraining these large models on individual concept deletion requests is infeasible, fine-tuning algorithms have been developed to tackle concept erasing in diffusion models. While these algorithms yield good concept erasure, they all present one of the following issues: 1) the semantics of the prompts change over time, 2) long and inefficient training exposes the model to more harm, and 3) the spatial structure distribution of each generated image is not preserved after fine-tuning. These issues severely degrade the original utility of generative models. In this work, we present a new approach that solves all of these challenges. We take inspiration from the concept of classifier guidance and propose a surgical update on the classifier guidance term while constraining the unconditional score term. Furthermore, our algorithm empowers the user to select an alternative to the erasing concept, allowing for more controllability. Our experimental results show that our algorithm not only erases the target concept effectively but also preserves the model's generation capability."

Homomorphic encryption allows for computations on encrypted data without decrypting it. Therefore, Blind-Touch can keep fingerprint data encrypted on the server while performing machine learning operations. Blind-Touch integrates three techniques to address the computational challenges of using homomorphic encryption for machine learning: (1) A distributed machine learning architecture that divides inference tasks between the client and server, thereby reducing encrypted computations on the server; (2) A data compression method that reduces client-server communication costs; and (3) A cluster architecture that improves scalability with the number of registered users. Blind-Touch achieves high accuracy on two benchmark fingerprint datasets, with a 93.6% F1-score for the PolyU dataset and a 98.2% F1-score for the SOKOTO dataset. Moreover, Blind-Touch can match a fingerprint among 5,000 in about 0.65 seconds.With its privacyfocused design, high accuracy, and efficiency, Blind-Touch is a promising alternative to conventional fingerprint authentication\nfor web and cloud applications."

        "abstract": "We propose a novel framework called Reinforced Adversarial Anomaly Detector (RAAD) based on Reinforcement Learning to mine and detect anomalies or attacks in the presence of very few attack or anomaly patterns in time-series. Our approach uses two adversarial agents, where one agent acts as an attacker and the other as a defender. The attacker agent learns a policy to disturb the defender agent by effectively sampling the defender’s worst-performing trajectories from synthetically generated states provided by the environment, while the defender agent learns a policy that can distinguish between the normal and abnormal (attack) states. Upon successful training of two adversarial policies, the defender agent can effectively evaluate whether a new observation follows the distribution of normal states. In particular, RAAD overcomes the inherent overfitting issue, which other approaches have, through adversarial training and Reinforcement Learning. Using multiple real-world anomaly and attack detection datasets, we demonstrate that RAAD outperforms the several other baseline approaches in identifying abnormal patterns."

The former adeptly captures salient actions in the journey through attention mechanisms, while the latter discerns temporal nuances, such as impulse and deliberate buying tendencies. This tailored approach enables digital marketing agencies to identify latent customers primed for purchase, thus optimizing targeted advertising and conversion strategies. Our experimental results affirm AAGRU’s superiority over extant deep learning models. Significantly, in simulations, AAGRU demonstrated impressive performance against our company’s best audience group."

Despite the critical role of representing emotion, existing emojis neglect the subtle and complex properties of human emotion in that only countable and finite face emojis exist in a categorical manner. In this article, we propose a novel approach to facial emoji generation, which can control the emotional degree of generated emojis for more complex and detailed usage on online conversations. In other words, we develop a new emotion aware emoji generative adversarial network, which is capable of generating an emoji that expresses a given emotion distribution. In this way, our approach aims to map fine grained emotions to expressive emojis. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrate that our approach can successfully generate high quality emoji like images by representing a wide range of emo tions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use the deep generative model from the standpoint of the emoji’s emotional role, which can further promote more interactive and effective online communication."

In addition, an Adversarial Weight Perturbation module is carefully devised to enable the model to be more robust against image corruption while boosting the overall model’s performance. Extensive experiments over seven popular deepfake datasets demonstrate the superiority of our QAD model over prior SOTA benchmarks."

We experiment on popular satellite image manipulation dataset to demonstrate that our method achieves the best performance, while the memory requirement and processing speed are not compromised compared to existing methods."

These materials pose significant challenges to human authentication, such as impersonation, misinformation, or even a threat to national security. To keep pace with these rapid advancements, several deepfake detection algorithms have been proposed, leading to an ongoing arms race between deepfake creators and deepfake detectors. Nevertheless, these detectors are often unreliable and frequently fail to detect deepfakes. This study highlights the challenges they face in detecting deepfakes, including (1) the pre-processing pipeline of artifacts and (2) the fact that generators of new, unseen deepfake samples have not been considered when building the defense models. Our work sheds light on the need for further research and development in this field to create more robust and reliable detectors."

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has drafted the DID standard and provided reference implementations. We conduct a security analysis of the W3C DID standard and the reference universal resolver implementation, focusing on user privacy in the DID resolving process. The universal resolver is the key component in the architecture that processes DID requests and DID document retrievals. Our analysis demonstrates that privacy issues can arise due to the imprudent design of the universal resolver. Furthermore, we found that side-channels in the DID document caching schemes of real-world DID services can entail privacy concerns. Motivated by our security analysis, we present a novel  DID resolving design, called Oblivira, to enable obliviously DID resolving. Oblivira is a secure resolving agent with a small footprint that enforces the universal resolver to resolve requests without knowing their content. We also propose a privacy-preserving DID document caching scheme that eliminates side-channels. Our evaluation results show that Oblivira only incurs approximately 2.6\\% of overhead on average with different resolver settings (3, 6, and 12 threads)."

Deepfake on social media has posed several credibility issues. We evaluate the racial bias in face recognition APIs using real and deepfake celebrity images. We use deepfake generation methods to introduce small, imperceptible changes to the real images to shift the racial class of predictions. As a result, we show how deepfake images exacerbated racial bias in Amazon, Microsoft, and Naver web-based face recognition APIs. The findings are significant because they reveal similar vulnerabilities to those previously discovered through adversarial attacks but through a significantly different method."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present SmartConDetect as a tool for detecting security vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. SmartConDetect is a static analysis tool that extracts code fragments from Solidity smart contracts and uses a pre-trained BERT model to find susceptible code patterns. To demonstrate the performance of SmartConDetect, we use two public datasets, and our dataset (SmartConDataset) collected from the real-world Ethereum blockchain network. Our experimental results show that SmartConDetect significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, achieving 90.9\\% F1-score when using our own dataset. Specifically, SmartConDetect is about 2 times faster than SmartCheck in detection. Furthermore, we conduct a real-world case study to analyze the distribution of detected vulnerabilities."

However, despite the success of vision transformers in colorizing the image and selectively colorizing the regions with user propagation hints, heavy underlying ViT architecture and the large number of required parameters hinder active real-time user interaction for colorization applications. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel efficient ViT architecture for real-time interactive colorization, A-ColViT that adaptively prunes the layers of vision transformer for every input sample. This method flexibly allocates computational resources of input samples, effectively achieving actual acceleration. In addition, we demonstrate through extensive experiments on ImageNet-ctest10k, Oxford 102flower, and CUB-200 datasets that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach and achieves actual acceleration."

After the model is trained, S-ViT tends to have a sparse distribution of weights compared to ViT, so we named it according to these characteristics. Unlike the conventional ViT, our proposed S-ViT adopts image Relative Positional Encoding (iRPE) method for positional encoding. Also, S-ViT has been modified so that all token embeddings, not just class token, participate in the decoding process. Through extensive experiment, we showed that S-ViT achieves better performance in closed-set than the other baseline models, and showed better performance than the baseline ViT-based models. We also show that the use of ArcFace loss functions yields greater performance gains in S-ViT than in baseline models. In addition, S-ViT has an advantage in cost-performance trade-off because it tends to be more robust to the pruning technique than the underlying model, ViT. Therefore, S-ViT offers the additional advantage, which can be applied more flexibly in the target devices with limited resources."

        "abstract": "Medical images, including computed tomography (CT) assist doctors and physicians in diagnosing anatomic structures and various internal pathologies. In CT, intravenous contrast media is often applied, which are chemicals developed to aid in the characterization of pathology by enhancing the capabilities of an imaging modality to differentiate between different biological tissues. Especially, with the use of contrast media, thorough examinations of the patients can be possible. However, contrast media can have severe adverse and side effects such as hypersensitive reaction to generalized seizures. Yet, without contrast media, it is difficult to diagnose patients that have disorders in the internal organs. With the help of DNN models, especially generative adversarial network (GAN), contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images can be synthetically generated from non-contrast CT (NCCT) images. GANs or autoencoder-based models have been proposed to generate contrast-enhanced CT images; however, the synthesized image does not fully reflect and have crucial spots where contrast has not been synthesized. Thus, in order to enhance the quality of the CECT image, we propose MGCMA, a multi-scale generator with a channel-wise mask attention module for generating synthetic CECT images from NCCT images. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms other baseline models in various metrics such as SSIM and LPIPS. Also, generated images from our approach achieve plausible outcomes from the domain experts' (e.g., physicians and radiologists) evaluations."

        "abstract": "Oriented object detection in aerial images is a challenging task due to the highly complex backgrounds and objects with arbitrary oriented and usually densely arranged. Existing oriented object detection methods adopt CNN-based methods, and they can be divided into three types: two-stage, one-stage, and anchor-free methods. All of them require non-maximum suppression (NMS) to eliminate the duplicated predictions. Recently, object detectors based on the transformer remove hand-designed components by directly solving set prediction problems via performing bipartite matching, and achieve state-of-the-art performances in general object detection. Motivated by this research, we propose a transformer-based oriented object detector named  Rotated DETR with oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) labeling. We embed the scoring network to reduce the tokens corresponding to the background. In addition, we apply a proposal generator and iterative proposal refinement in order to provide proposals with angle information to the transformer decoder. Rotated DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-stage and anchor-free oriented object detectors on DOTA, UCAS-AOD, and DIOR-R datasets with only 10\\% feature tokens. In the experiment, we show the effectiveness of the scoring network and iterative proposal refinement."

In most cases, raw images are compressed with encoding algorithms such as JPEG to cope with resource limitations. However, the standard JPEG optimized for human visual systems may induce significant accuracy loss in DNN inference tasks. In addition, the standard JPEG compresses all regions in an image at the same quality level, while some areas may not contain valuable information for the target task. In this paper, we propose a target-driven JPEG compression framework that performs region-adaptive quantization of the DCT coefficients. The region-based quality map is generated from an end-to-end trainable neural network. In addition, we present a deep learning approach to remove the requirement of storing the overhead information induced by the region-based encoding process. Our framework can be easily implemented on devices with commonly used JPEG and also produce images that achieve a higher compression rate with minimum degradation of the classification accuracy."

        "abstract": "Conventional forgery localizing methods usually rely on different forgery footprints such as JPEG artifacts, edge inconsistency, camera noise, etc., with cross-entropy loss to locate manipulated regions. However, these methods have the disadvantage of over-fitting and focusing on only a few specific forgery footprints. On the other hand, real-life manipulated images are generated via a wide variety of forgery operations and thus, leave behind a wide variety of forgery footprints. Therefore, we need a more general approach for image forgery localization that can work well on a variety of forgery conditions. A key assumption in underlying forged region localization is that there remains a difference of feature distribution between untampered and manipulated regions in each forged image sample, irrespective of the forgery type. In this paper, we aim to leverage this difference of feature distribution to aid in image forgery localization. Specifically, we use contrastive loss to learn mapping into a feature space where the features between untampered and manipulated regions are well-separated for each image. Also, our method has the advantage of localizing manipulated region without requiring any prior knowledge or assumption about the forgery type. We demonstrate that our work outperforms several existing methods on three benchmark image manipulation datasets."

Our framework consists of three steps: 1) extracting bias-conflict samples from a biased dataset in an unsupervised manner, 2) training a generative model with the biased dataset and adapting biased distribution from the generative model to the extracted bias-conflict samples' distribution, and 3) augmenting bias-conflict samples by translating bias-align samples with the trained generative model.

        "abstract": "Information has exploded on the Internet and mobile with the advent of the big data era. In particular, recommendation systems are widely used to help consumers who struggle to select the best products among such a large amount of information. However, recommendation systems are vulnerable to malicious user biases, such as fake reviews to promote or demote specific products, as well as attacks that steal personal information. Such biases and attacks compromise the fairness of the recommendation model and infringe the privacy of users and systems by distorting data.Recently, deep-learning collaborative filtering recommendation systems have shown to be more vulnerable to this bias. In this position paper, we examine the effects of bias that cause various ethical and social issues, and discuss the need for designing the robust recommendation system for fairness and stability."

        "abstract": "Most dynamic pruning methods fail to achieve actual acceleration due to the extra overheads caused by indexing and weight-copying to implement the dynamic sparse patterns for every input sample. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Pattern-based Pruning Network, which preserves the advantages of both static and dynamic networks. Unlike previous dynamic pruning methods, our novel method dynamically fuses static kernel patterns, enhancing the kernel's representational power without additional overhead. Moreover, our dynamic sparse pattern enables an efficient process using BLAS libraries, accomplishing actual acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network on CIFAR and ImageNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods achieving better accuracy with lower computational cost."

By adding representation features from subtitles, which are pretrained with a self-supervised contrastive framework, our Samba model can outperform other state-of-the-art classifiers by at least 7%.

In this study, we demonstrate that adding modest adversarial perturbations to sensor data severely weakens anomaly detection systems.   Under well-known adversarial attacks such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), which claim to be robust against anomalies and possibly be used in real-world systems, drops to 0%. We demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the vulnerability of anomaly detection systems to adversarial attacks.

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a powerful technique for improving the performance of a small model by leveraging the knowledge of a larger model. Despite its remarkable performance boost, KD has a drawback with the substantial computational cost of pre-training larger models in advance. Recently, a method called self-knowledge distillation has emerged to improve the model's performance without any supervision. In this paper, we present a novel plug-in approach called Sliding Cross Entropy (SCE) method, which can be combined with existing self-knowledge distillation to significantly improve the performance. Specifically, to minimize the difference between the output of the model and the soft target obtained by self-distillation, we split each softmax representation by a certain window size, and reduce the distance between sliced parts. Through this approach, the model evenly considers all the inter-class relationships of a soft target during optimization. The extensive experiments show that our approach is effective in various tasks, including classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. We also demonstrate SCE consistently outperforms existing baseline methods."

        "abstract": "Although the collision of space objects not only incurs a high cost but also threatens human life, the risk of collision between satellites has increased, as the number of satellites has rapidly grown due to the significant interests in many space applications. However, it is not trivial to monitor the behavior of the satellite in real-time since the communication between the ground station and spacecraft are dynamic and sparse, and there is an increased latency due to the long distance. Accordingly, it is strongly required to predict the orbit of a satellite to prevent unexpected contingencies such as a collision. Therefore, the real-time monitoring and accurate orbit prediction is required. Furthermore, it is necessarily to compress the prediction model, while achieving a high prediction performance in order to be deployable in the real systems. Although several machine learning and deep learning-based prediction approaches have been studied to address such issues, most of them have applied only basic machine learning models for orbit prediction without considering the size, running time, and complexity of the prediction model. In this research, we propose Selective Tensorized multi-layer LSTM (ST-LSTM) for orbit prediction, which not only improves the orbit prediction performance but also compresses the size of the model that can be applied in practical deployable scenarios. To evaluate our model, we use the real orbit dataset collected from the Korea Multi-Purpose Satellites (KOMPSAT-3 and KOMPSAT-3A) of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) for 5 years. In addition, we compare our ST-LSTM to other machine learning-based regression models, LSTM, and basic tensorized LSTM models with regard to the prediction performance, model compression rate, and running time."

However, recent KD approaches for object detection have faced two limitations. First, they distill nearby foreground regions, ignoring potentially useful background information. Second, they only consider global contexts, thereby the student model can hardly learn local details from the teacher model. To overcome such challenging issues, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method, GLAMD, distilling both global and local knowledge from the teacher. We divide the feature maps into several patches and apply an attention mechanism for both the entire feature area and each patch to extract the global context as well as local details simultaneously. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 40.8 AP on COCO2017 dataset, which is 3.4 AP higher than the student model (ResNet50 based Faster R-CNN) and 0.7 AP higher than the previous global attention-based distillation method."

In the wake of the strengthening of on-site guidelines by the National Police Agency and the adjustment of the prosecution and police investigation rights, the need for identification and autopsy at the scene is being emphasized. Although the existing forensic face restoration technology using face bones has accumulated a number of previous studies, there is a limitation in that the restoration results may vary due to many factors such as the thickness and nature of facial soft tissue, shape of eyes or nose, and distribution of body hair. Based on the fact that facial recognition technology using facial landmarks is becoming common all over the world, this study aims to help quickly and accurately identify the faces of corrupt bodies that expand due to postmortem-change.\nIn this study, living data such as ID cards and post-mortem data were collected for bodies identified with fingerprints, and compared pairs were formed, and face recognition technology used the MTCNN model, which is currently widely used in the field. The artificial intelligence model, which determines whether live data and post-data match, selected and analyzed Arcface, which is the same among a total of seven open-source models (VGG-Face, FaceNet, OpenFace, DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace, Dlib).\nThe performance of the artificial intelligence model (Arcface) was evaluated by comparing the results of the judgment of the expert group, the general public group, and the entire human group. As a result of comparison using 107 pairs of original data, the same person judgment rate was found to be 51.4% in the expert group, 22.4% in the general population, and 29.0% in the total human group, and the artificial intelligence model was 47.7%. As a result of reviewing the original data, it was determined that changes in skin color due to decomposition could affect the performance of artificial intelligence models According to this judgment, when the original data were preprocessed in gray scale, the judgment rate of the same person as the artificial intelligence model was 50.5%, which showed an improvement in performance of about 3%. \nThrough this study, it was found that only the currently developed artificial intelligence model showed facial recognition performance close to that of a group of experts. It is expected that face recognition performance can be further improved if various pretreatment technologies reflecting the characteristics of the postmortem change are developed and applied in the future.\n인구 고령화 및 1인 가구의 증가는 고독사의 증가로 이어져 변사사건에서 부패 시신이 발견되는 빈도가 점차 높아지고 있다. 경찰청의 현장 지침 강화 및 검경 수사권 조정 등을 계기로 현장에서는 신원 확인 및 부검의 필요성이 강조되고 있다. 얼굴뼈를 활용한 기존의 법의학적 얼굴 복원 기술은 다수의 선행연구 결과가 축적되어 있지만, 얼굴 연부조직의 두께나 성상, 눈이나 코의 형태, 체모의 분포 등의 고려 요소가 많아 복원 결과가 달라질 수 있다는 한계가 존재한다. 본 연구는 얼굴의 특징점(face landmark)을 활용하는 얼굴 인식 기술이 전세계적으로 보편화되고 있다는 점에 착안하여, 사후변화로 인해 연부조직이 팽창된 부패 시신의 얼굴을 복원하거나 생전의 사진과 비교하여 동일인 여부를 판정함으로써 신속하고 정확한 신원확인에 도움을 주고자 한다. \n 본 연구에서는 지문 등으로 신원이 확인된 시신을 대상으로 신분증 등의 생전 데이터와 검안 또는 부검 당시 촬영된 사후데이터를 수집한 뒤 각각 짝을 지어 비교쌍을 구성하였으며, 얼굴 인식 기술은 현재 해당 분야에서 많이 활용되고 있는 MTCNN 모델을 활용하였다. 생전데이터와 사후데이터의 일치 여부를 판단하는 인공지능모델은 총 7개의 open source 모델(VGG-Face, FaceNet, OpenFace, DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace, Dlib) 중 가장 동일인 판정률의 빈도가 가장 높게 나타난 Arcface를 선정하여 분석하였다.\n 인공지능모델(Arcface)의 성능은 전문가집단과 일반인 집단, 전체 사람 집단의 판정 결과와 비교하여 평가하였다. 원본 데이터 107쌍을 이용한 비교 결과, 동일인 판정률은 전문가집단 51.4%, 일반인 22.4%, 전체 사람 집단 29.0%로 조사되었으며, 인공지능모델은 47.7%로 나타났다. 원본 데이터를 검토한 결과, 부패로 인한 피부색의 변화가 인공지능모델의 성능에 영향을 줄 가능성이 있다고 판단되었다. 이러한 판단에 따라 원본 데이터를 회색조(gray scale)로 전처리하였을 때 인공지능모델의 동일인 판정률은 50.5%로, 약 3%의 성능이 향상되는 것을 볼 수 있었다. \n본 연구를 통해 현재 개발되어 있는 인공지능모델만으로도 전문가 집단에 근접한 얼굴 인식 성능을 보이는 것을 알 수 있었다. 향후 사후변화의 특성을 반영한 다양한 전처리 기법을 개발하여 적용할 경우 얼굴 인식 성능을 더욱 향상시킬 수 있을 것으로 기대된다."

Both streams of approach have seen enormous success in terms of detection accuracy due to their abilities to learn compressed data representations and model temporal dependencies, respectively. However, most existing methods disregard the relationships between features, information that would be extremely useful when incorporated into the model. How can we effectively combine the best of reconstruction and forecasting models while also capturing feature interdependencies? In this work, we introduce Fused Sparse Autoencoder and Graph Net (FuSAGNet), which jointly optimizes reconstruction and forecasting while explicitly modeling the relationships within multivariate time series. Our approach combines Sparse Autoencoder and Graph Neural Network, the latter of which predicts future time series behavior from sparse latent representations learned by the former as well as graph structures learned through recurrent feature embedding. Experimenting on three real-world cyber-physical system datasets, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the overall anomaly detection performance, outperforming baseline approaches. Moreover, we show that mining sparse latent patterns from high-dimensional time series improves the robustness of the graph-based forecasting model. Lastly, we conduct visual analyses to investigate the interpretability of both recurrent feature embedding vectors and sparse latent representations."

In addition to normal content, there is an extensive amount of manipulated multimedia that can raise various social issues and concerns. Among the various types of manipulated media, deepfakes can be abused in impersonation or spreading fake information. Therefore, numerous studies have been performed to detect deepfakes to alleviate these concerns, and studies such as FaceForensics++ (FF++) and DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) have sparked these studies by providing deepfake datasets. The deepfake datasets were utilized for supervised learning in conjunction with developing sophisticated neural networks and showed a high detection performance. Since powerful neural networks can learn even subtle details about an image, they must be trained on realistic deepfakes created by advanced deepfake generation technologies to improve the robustness of existing detectors. In order to boost the performance of deepfake detection models, we propose an approach to creating more realistic deepfake images by removing \"detectable\" artifacts from existing deepfake datasets' images. By applying the proposed method to the original deepfake dataset, we demonstrate that our technique can significantly reduce the detection performance of existing deepfake detectors.

        "abstract": "With the rise of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), user data holders should guarantee the “individual’s right to be forgotten”. It means user data holders must completely remove user data when they receive the request. However, enabling a deep learning model to exclude specific data used during training is challenging. We can’t define what is ”forgetting” in deep learning and how to do it. To address this issue, we propose an efficient machine unlearning architecture to be used for computer vision classification models. Our approach consists of two-stage, where in the first stage we render a deep learning model that loses information with contrastive labels in the requested dataset. Second, we retrain the first stage output model with knowledge distillation (KD). Using this two-stage approach, we can substantiate the removal or forgetness of the requested dataset in the deep learning model. With various datasets used for multimedia applications, we demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par or even higher accuracy than the original model, while effectively removing the requested data."

        "abstract": "Recently, various image synthesis technologies have increased the prevalence of impersonation attacks, and with the development of such technologies, the amount of damage such as defamation has also increased. Deepfake, the representative of the impersonation technique, has already evolved to the point where people cannot distinguish, leading to an urgent need for detection methods. Currently, in order to detect deepfakes, many deepfake datasets are widely used in deep neural networks using supervision learning. However, although this method is robust to the images synthesized by deepfake generation methods already known, it remains undefined whether deepfakes created by unknown techniques can be detected. Accordingly, to detect more challenging deepfakes, we present a pre-processing technique that mitigates the artifacts of deepfakes and makes them appear more natural. The proposed method can be combined with the existing deepfake creation method to generate a more threatening deepfake image. Furthermore, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method can significantly lower the performance of state-of-the-art detectors and expose the vulnerability of deployed detectors."

In this research, we aim to expand our understanding of passwords through the lenses of data-driven analysis by characterizing a large number of password datasets with four different hypotheses. In particular, we use the tensor decomposition method that is effective in analyzing unlabeled high dimensional data. We first obtain 362,805 passwords from four different leaked password datasets. Next, we generate syntactic and semantic features for each password, then classify it into three strength groups using a statistical guessing attack model.

The advancement of automated Deepfake (DF) generation tools that mimic certain targets has rendered society vulnerable to fake news or misinformation propagation. In real-world scenarios, DF videos are compressed to low-quality (LQ) videos, taking up less storage space and facilitating dissemination through the web and social media. Such LQ DF videos are much more challenging to detect than high-quality (HQ) DF videos. To address this challenge, we rethink the design of standard deep learning-based DF detectors, specifically exploiting feature extraction to enhance the features of LQ images. We propose a novel LQ DF detection architecture, multi-scale Branch Zooming Network (BZNet), which adopts an unsupervised super-resolution (SR) technique and utilizes multi-scale images for training. We train our BZNet only using highly compressed LQ images and experiment under a realistic setting, where HQ training data are not readily accessible. Extensive experiments on the FaceForensics++ LQ and GAN-generated datasets demonstrate that our BZNet architecture improves the detection accuracy of existing CNN-based classifiers by 4.21\\% on average. Furthermore, we evaluate our method against a real-world Deepfake-in-the-Wild dataset collected from the internet, which contains 200 videos featuring 50 celebrities worldwide, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 4.13%."

Unfortunately, anomalies do not always cause large residuals. Anomaly detection algorithms based on residual size can miss anomalies that cause only small or noisy residuals for each variable in a multivariate time-series. To overcome this issue, we propose \"neighbors to residuals\" (N2RE), a novel anomaly scoring function based on residual similarity using nearest neighbor distance (NND). Even if residuals of anomalies are small, they show patterns that are different from those of residuals of normal data. Using N2RE can improve anomaly detection performance and reduce the variation in anomaly detection performance due to threshold changes. Experiments with various models on three cyber-physical system datasets verify that N2RE can achieve 19% higher anomaly detection performance than previous approaches without changes to the models."

Further, we evaluate\nreal vs. fake human face detection task as a practical use case scenario. Our approach achieves high performance as well as training data efficiency, where the essence of our approach is based on tensor decomposition to ensure face data privacy. In particular, we demonstrate that the core tensor of Tucker decomposition generated from the original face input can effectively represent the underlying characteristics of the original face data; that is, learning only from the core tensors is sufficient for differentiating real human face images from deepfakes. Also, we show that the original human face inputs are anonymized and cannot be recovered from the core tensors under different attacker models from the randomized HOOI algorithm. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our method can result in high detection performance comparable to those of popular anonymization methods. Therefore, we show that our work strikes the balance between privacy and performance through the novel use of tensor decomposition."

However, accurately detecting human speech is challenging, especially in the presence of unknown noise patterns. Generally, deep learning-based methods have shown to be more robust and accurate than statistical methods and other existing approaches. However, typically creating a noise-robust and more generalized deep learning-based Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system requires the collection of an enormous amount of annotated audio data. In this work, we develop a generalized model trained on limited types of human speeches with noisy backgrounds. Yet, it can detect human speech in the presence of various unseen noise types, which were not present in the training set. To achieve this, we propose a One-Class Residual connections-based Variational Autoencoder (ORVAE), which only requires a limited number of human speech data with noisy background for training, thereby eliminating the need for collecting data with diverse noise patterns. Evaluating ORVAE with three different datasets (synthesized TIMIT and NOI\nSEX-92, synthesized LibriSpeech and NOISEX-92, and a Publicly Recorded dataset), our method outperforms other one-class baseline methods, achieving 1-scores of over 90% for multiple Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels."

        "abstract": "Significant advancements made in the generation of deepfakes have caused security and privacy issues. Attackers can easily impersonate a person's identity in an image by replacing his face with the target person's face. Moreover, a new domain of cloning human voices using deep-learning technologies is also emerging. Now, an attacker can generate realistic cloned voices of humans using only a few seconds of audio of the target person. With the emerging threat of potential harm deepfakes can cause, researchers have proposed deepfake detection methods. However, they only focus on detecting a single modality, i.e., either video or audio. On the other hand, to develop a good deepfake detector that can cope with the recent advancements in deepfake generation, we need to have a detector that can detect deepfakes of multiple modalities, i.e., videos and audios. To build such a detector, we need a dataset that contains video and respective audio deepfakes. We were able to find a most recent deepfake dataset, Audio-Video Multimodal Deepfake Detection Dataset (FakeAVCeleb), that contains not only deepfake videos but synthesized fake audios as well. We used this multimodal deepfake dataset and performed detailed baseline experiments using state-of-the-art unimodal, ensemble-based, and multimodal detection methods to evaluate it. We conclude through detailed experimentation that unimodals, addressing only a single modality, video or audio, do not perform well compared to ensemble-based methods. Whereas purely multimodal-based baselines provide the worst performance."

        "abstract": "While the significant advancements have made in the generation of deepfakes using deep learning technologies, its misuse is a well-known issue now. Deepfakes can cause severe security and privacy issues as they can be used to impersonate a person's identity in a video by replacing his/her face with another person's face. Recently, a new problem of generating synthesized human voice of a person is emerging, where AI-based deep learning models can synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few seconds of audio. With the emerging threat of impersonation attacks using deepfake audios and videos, a new generation of deepfake detectors is needed to focus on both video and audio collectively. To develop a competent deepfake detector, a large amount of high-quality data is typically required to capture real-world (or practical) scenarios. Existing deepfake datasets either contain deepfake videos or audios, which are racially biased as well. As a result, it is critical to develop a high-quality video and audio deepfake dataset that can be used to detect both audio and video deepfakes simultaneously. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Audio-Video Deepfake dataset, FakeAVCeleb, which contains not only deepfake videos but also respective synthesized lip-synced fake audios. We generate this dataset using the most popular deepfake generation methods. We selected real YouTube videos of celebrities with four ethnic backgrounds to develop a more realistic multimodal dataset that addresses racial bias, and further help develop multimodal deepfake detectors. We performed several experiments using state-of-the-art detection methods to evaluate our deepfake dataset and demonstrate the challenges and usefulness of our multimodal Audio-Video deepfake dataset."

        "abstract": "Detection of fallen persons due to, for example, health problems, violence, or accidents, is a critical challenge. Accordingly, detection of these anomalous events is of paramount importance for a number of applications, including but not limited to CCTV surveillance, security, and health care. Given that many detection systems rely on a comprehensive dataset comprising fallen person images collected under diverse environments and in various situations is crucial. However, existing datasets are limited to only specific environmental conditions and lack diversity. To address the above challenges and help researchers develop more robust detection systems, we create a novel, large-scale dataset for the detection of fallen persons composed of fallen person images collected in various real-world scenarios, with the support of the South Korean government. Our Vision-based Fallen Person (VFP290K) dataset consists of 294,714 frames of fallen persons extracted from 178 videos, including 131 scenes in 49 locations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the features through extensive experiments analyzing the performance shift based on object detection models. In addition, we evaluate our VFP290K dataset with properly divided versions of our dataset by measuring the performance of fallen person detecting systems. We ranked first in the first round of the anomalous behavior recognition track of AI Grand Challenge 2020, South Korea, using our VFP290K dataset, which can be found here. Our achievement implies the usefulness of our dataset for research on fallen person detection, which can further extend to other applications, such as intelligent CCTV or monitoring systems. The data and more up-to-date information have been provided at our VFP290K site."

        "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art autonomous driving technology significantly advanced, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, because it is not easy to apply a rule-based driving method that reflects all the various traffic conditions. Indeed, reinforcement learning can produce the possible optimal driving strategy of urban, rural, and motorway roads in various environmental conditions such as speed limits and school zones. However, it is challenging to adjust the parameters of the reward mechanism in RL, because the driving style of each user is very different. And it takes a massive amount of time and resources to conduct RL by reflecting all complex traffic conditions. However, if RL imitates the driving behavior of an expert, RL algorithm can proceed more quickly. Therefore, we propose a novel imitation learning framework, which combines an expert's driving behavior with a continuous behavior of an agent. Further, a deep reinforcement learning approach is used to mimic the expert's driving behavior. Therefore, we propose imitation learning with variational inference and distributional reinforcement learning (IVDR) algorithm. Our results show that IVDR achieves 80% better learning speed than the learning speed of other approaches and outperforms 12% higher in average reward. Our work shows great promise of using RL for autonomous driving and real vehicle driving simulation."

In this paper, we propose an Efficient Multi-Scale Feature Generation Adaptive Network (EMGNet), which not only reduced the redundancy of the architecture but also generates multi-scale features to improve the performance of the early exit network."

Although many proposed methods succeed in detecting GAN-based synthetic images, they are still limited by the need for large quantities of the training fake image dataset and challenges for the detector's generalizability to unknown facial images. In this paper, we propose a new approach that explores the asynchronous frequency spectra of color channels, which is simple but effective for training both unsupervised and supervised learning models to distinguish GAN-based synthetic images. We further investigate the transferability of a training model that learns from our suggested features in one source domain and validates on another target domains with prior knowledge of the features' distribution. Our experimental results show that the discrepancy of spectra in the frequency domain is a practical artifact to effectively detect various types of GAN-based generated images."

To better cope with unknown and unseen deepfakes, we introduce a Convolutional LSTM-based Residual Network (CLRNet), which adopts a unique model training strategy and explores spatial as well as the temporal information in a deepfakes. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing defense methods are not ready for real-world deployment. Whereas our defense method (CLRNet) achieves far better generalization when detecting various benchmark deepfake methods (97.57% on average). Furthermore, we evaluate our approach with a high-quality DeepFake-in-the-Wild dataset, collected from the Internet containing numerous videos and having more than 150,000 frames. Our CLRNet model demonstrated that it generalizes well against high-quality DFW videos by achieving 93.86% detection accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art defense methods by a considerable margin."

We evaluate BertLoc trained with more than half a million location data used in real service in South Korea and compare the results with other popular baseline methods.

Detecting high-quality deepfake videos from widely released datasets is more straightforward to detect than low-quality ones. Most of the prior research achieve above 90% accuracy for detecting the high-quality deepfake videos from the open dataset. However, in real life, many deepfake videos that are leaked through social networks such as YouTube and instant messaging applications are highly compressed. As a result, the distributed video's resolution becomes extremely lower, making the state-of-the-art detection methods harder. In this work, we propose ZoomNet, a practical framework to detect low-quality deepfakes with high accuracy. We build ZoomNet to have the ability to zoom into low-quality images effectively and can learn to distinguish deepfakes from real videos."

We propose a new authentication mechanism, called life-experience passwords (LEPs)."

Yet, many competitions require extensive preparation, strong coding skills and solid background knowledge, not just in security, but also in system administration, networking and operating systems. As such, competitions may discourage novices that lack in one of these required areas. In this paper we discuss our experience in using Class Capture-theFlag Exercises (CCTFs) to bridge this gap in classes, and in 2015 ACM Richard Tapia Security workshop. We recount lessons learned and map a way forward, towards collaborative, more structured cybersecurity competitions that better support and engage novices, and offer a positive learning experience to all."
